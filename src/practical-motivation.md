## Problem Overview

The [Singapore Cyber Landscape 2022](https://www.csa.gov.sg/Tips-Resource/publications/2023/singapore-cyber-landscape-2022) report by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore reveals a growing increase in phishing cases, with the number more than doubling from 2021 to 2022. This trend highlights the escalating threat of phishing in today's technology-driven world. Despite repeated phishing advisories from public defence agencies and corporate banks, many individuals still fall victim to phishing attacks. The primary reason lies in the difficulty of distinguishing well-crafted phishing websites from legitimate ones.

## Project Goal

Our group aims to address this growing problem by developing a detection tool that can reliably differentiate between malicious and benign websites. Our solution will focus on analysing the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address used to access websites. URLs contain a wealth of information, including subtle obfuscation techniques used by threat actors to mask malicious intent. Dubbed **Phishermen's Cove**, the detection tool will use heuristics to analyse URLs and identify the subtle obfuscation techniques commonly used in malicious websites.
